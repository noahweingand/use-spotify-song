# use-spotify-song

A React hook to fetch your currently playing or your most recently played Spotify song.

## Features

- ðŸŒŽ **Universal**: provides esm and cjs modules.
- ðŸŒ³ **Tree shaking**: grab only what you need.
- ðŸ’ª **Strongly typed**: Typescript support.

## Getting Started

> `yarn add use-spotify-song`

You'll need to register an application with [Spotify for Developers](https://developer.spotify.com/) to use this hook. You'll also need an access token from Spotify's OAuth. Instructions to get that are [here](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/authorization/).

`use-spotify-song` uses [SWR](https://swr.vercel.app/), a react hook for data fetching, under the hood. Most of SWR's data-fetching capabilitities available through the package are exposed through this hook as well.

## Examples

Provide the context to your application and specify your access token.

```jsx
import { SpotifySongConfig } from 'use-spotify-song';

<SpotifySongConfig.Provider value={{ accessToken }}>{children}</SpotifySongConfig.Provider>;
```

Access the song and a loading state from the hook.

```jsx
import { useSpotifySong } from 'use-spotify-song';

const Component = () => {
  const { song, isLoading } = useSpotifySong();

  return <p>{isLoading ? 'Loading...' : song?.name}</p>;
};
```

`use-spotify-song` supports refreshing on an interval (polling). Provide a number in milliseconds in the configuration!

```jsx
<SpotifySongConfig.Provider value={{ accessToken, config: { refreshInterval: 5000 } }}>
  ...
</SpotifySongConfig.Provider>
```

Support for Suspense, offered by React 18, is available. Turn it on in the configuration to allow for data loading that "just works".

```jsx
<SpotifySongConfig.Provider value={{ accessToken, config: { suspense: true } }}>
  ...
</SpotifySongConfig.Provider>
```

```jsx
const Parent = () => {
  return (
    <Suspense fallback={<p>Loading...</p>}>
      <Component />
    </Suspense>
  );
};

const Component = () => {
  const { song } = useSpotifySong();

  return <p>{song?.name}</p>;
};
```

One may also access a callback to revalidate the song. as well as a state for if the song is validating.

```jsx
const Component = () => {
  const { song, isLoading, update, isUpdating } = useSpotifySong();

  return (
    <>
      <p>{song?.name}</p>
      <button onClick={() => update()}>Get new song!</button>
      {isUpdating && <span>Updating...</span>}
    </>
  );
};
```
