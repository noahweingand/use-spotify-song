# use-spotify-song

A React hook for to fetch the your currently playing Spotify song, or your most recently played. Polling support available!

## Features

- ðŸŒ³ **Universal**: provides esm and cjs modules.
- ðŸ’ª **Strongly typed**: Typescript support.

## Getting Started

You'll need to register an application with [Spotify for Developers](https://developer.spotify.com/) to use this hook. You'll also need an access token from Spotify's OAuth system. Instructions to get that are [here](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/authorization/).

`yarn add use-spotify-song`

## Example

Access the song, any errors, and a loading state from the hook.

```jsx
import { useSpotifySong } from 'use-spotify-song';

const Component = () => {
  const { song, error, loaded } = useSpotifySong('client-id', 'secret', 'access-token');

  return <p>{loaded ? song?.name : 'Loading...'}</p>;
};
```

To only get the most recently played song, provide it in the hook configuration.

```jsx
const Component = () => {
  const { song, error, loaded } = useSpotifySong('client-id', 'secret', 'access-token', {
    recentOnly: true,
  });

  return <p>{loaded ? song?.name : 'Loading...'}</p>;
};
```

`use-spotify-song` supports polling for song updates. Provide a number in seconds in the configuration!

```jsx
const Component = () => {
  const { song, error, loaded } = useSpotifySong('client-id', 'secret', 'access-token', {
    interval: 30,
  });

  return <p>{loaded ? song?.name : 'Loading...'}</p>;
};
```

One may also access a callback to re-fetch an updated song on your own prerogative.

```jsx
const Component = () => {
  const { song, error, loaded, getSong } = useSpotifySong('client-id', 'secret', 'access-token', {
    interval: 30,
  });

  return (
    <>
      <p>{loaded ? song?.name : 'Loading...'}</p>
      <button onClick={getSong}>Get new song!</button>
    </>
  );
};
```
